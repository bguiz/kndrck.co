Hi! I'm Kendrick Tan, a software engineer who enjoys solving hard technical problems. 

I'm currently focusing on the decentralized finance and privacy space within the Ethereum ecosystem.

In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, bouldering, ultimate frisbee, and learning random new things.

I'm fluent in English, conversational in Mandarin, and am learning Russian.

Feel free to contact me at `me at kndrck.co`. I enjoy emails. And cats. Do follow my <a href="https://instagram.com/mr.miso.oz">cat on instagram</a>
